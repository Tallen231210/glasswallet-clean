# GlassWallet Development Phases - Progress Tracking

This document tracks the actual development progress against the original 5-phase plan from the PRD.

## 📋 Original 5-Phase Plan

Based on `/docs/prd/12-development-phases.md`:

### ✅ Phase 1: Core MVP (Weeks 1-4) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Authentication system (Clerk) 
- ✅ Glassmorphic dashboard UI with neon green theme
- ✅ Credit balance management with circular progress
- ✅ CRS API integration (scaffolded)
- ✅ Lead processing form with floating labels
- ✅ Stripe billing setup (planned)
- ✅ Basic lead tagging (manual whitelist/blacklist)

**Status:** Complete - Built comprehensive MVP with enhanced lead management and mock credit reports

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Auto-Tagging Rules Engine - COMPLETED (Built Out of Sequence)
**Note:** This was originally planned as Phase 3 but was implemented as Phase 2.

#### What Was Built:
- ✅ **Sophisticated Visual Rule Builder**
  - 9 field types (creditScore, income, email, phone, state, city, firstName, lastName, zipCode)
  - 12+ operators (>=, <=, >, <, =, !=, contains, starts_with, ends_with, in, not_in, matches_pattern)
  - AND/OR logic combinations with visual preview

- ✅ **Comprehensive Action System**
  - 5 action types: add_tags, assign_rep, flag_review, send_notification, pixel_sync
  - Parameter configuration for each action type
  - Real-time action preview

- ✅ **Advanced Rule Management Dashboard**
  - Search and filtering by name, status, success rate
  - Sorting by priority, name, success rate, executions
  - Inline priority editing and status toggles
  - Rule duplication, editing, deletion with confirmations
  - Comprehensive rule analytics and insights

- ✅ **Rule Testing & Simulation**
  - Testing against 5 diverse sample lead profiles
  - Real-time automation simulation with live feeds
  - Detailed condition evaluation and action execution logging
  - Performance metrics and processing time tracking

- ✅ **Enhanced Analytics**
  - Performance rankings with medal system
  - Action type distribution charts
  - Optimization recommendations and insights
  - Recent activity timeline and success rate analysis

**Commit:** `69b4abd` - Implement comprehensive Auto-Tagging Rules Engine with advanced visual builder
